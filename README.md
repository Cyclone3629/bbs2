Hello!
The original project was blocked. Here's a new one.
This is much more limited as many of the unblockers are not in development anymore and of the ones that are, many of them are already blocked. The ones that still do work are very complicated to install, and if you are here I assume you don't know how to do that. For now, then, here is a proxy site you can host.
# Before you use:
Make sure you have a GitHub account. 
# Setting up:
1. Go to [Interstellar](https://github.com/InterstellarNetwork/Interstellar) and create a Fork. The fork button is in the top right corner.
2. Once you have your fork and are on it's page, press the green Code button, then Codespaces, then Create or Add a new codespace.
3. Once you are in your codespace and it is fully loaded, type in the terminal onscreen: pnpm i && pnpm start.
3a. You will only have to do step 3 once. Every time after, just type pnpm start.
